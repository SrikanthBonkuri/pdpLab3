Task 3 â€“ The winning lottery number and prize 

Hint: Based on the collection framework 

Suppose you have been asked to develop a program to manage a sweepstake activity where a certain set of winning numbers are randomly generated and stored in an appropriate collection structure. The count of the numbers to generated is fixed, say n. Suppose that each of these numbers is less than 99. Then ask the person playing the game to enter an equal count of numbers, which are stored. These two sets of numbers are used to establish the number of matches between the two sets. The number of matches is used to determine the winning prize for the player, such as a multiple of a base amount of 1000 by the cube of the number of matches established.
